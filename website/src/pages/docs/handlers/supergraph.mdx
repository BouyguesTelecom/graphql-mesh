# Federation Supergraph

You can use GraphQL Mesh as a Federation supergraph in multiple ways. You can either provide each
source, and let Mesh build your supergraph, or you can provide prebuilt Supergraph SDL.

## Consuming prebuilt Supergraph SDL

If you use Apollo Rover CLI or GraphQL Hive to compose your subgraphs, you can easily consume the
prebuilt supergraph SDL by using Supergraph handler;

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/supergraph
```

```yaml
sources:
  - name: Supergraph
    handler:
      supergraph:
        source: http://some-source.com/supergraph.sdl # it can be a path from the file system `./supergraph.graphql`
        schemaHeaders:
          myTokenHeader: MY_TOKEN_VALUE
```

## Using Mesh to build the supergraph

You can provide the existing subgraphs within GraphQL Mesh, or you can use
[Federation Subgraph](/docs/transforms/federation) to create subgraphs from regular sources.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: accounts
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: http://localhost:9871/graphql
    transforms:
      - federation:
          types:
            - name: User
              config:
                key:
                  - fields: id
                resolveReference:
                  queryFieldName: user
                  args:
                    id: '{root.id}'
  - name: reviews
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: http://localhost:9872/graphql
  - name: products
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: http://localhost:9873/graphql
  - name: inventory
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: http://localhost:9874/graphql
```
